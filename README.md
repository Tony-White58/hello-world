Old Dog, time for new tricks, something fun

Lol, ok hm have messed with computers and networks long before the internet, Platers, Floppyâ€™s and all things dinosaurs.  Anyone remember NetWare by Novell Inc. 1984 I started, omg... then how about Dos, and windows 286, 386 etc. getting the picture?  Old dog, new tricks, :-)

Rust is something that caught my eye, and well time to chk it out.

Oh my family has been building homes for 3 generations and I am doing the same now, much more relaxing.
